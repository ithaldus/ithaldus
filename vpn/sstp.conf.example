# SSTP VPN Configuration Template
#
# SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol) is commonly used with Windows servers.
#
# Required environment variables:
#   SSTP_SERVER=vpn.example.com
#   VPN_USERNAME=your-username
#   VPN_PASSWORD=your-password
#
# Optional files:
#   vpn/ca.crt - CA certificate for server verification
#
# The container will connect using:
#   sstpc --user $VPN_USERNAME --password $VPN_PASSWORD $SSTP_SERVER
#
# If vpn/ca.crt exists, it will be used for server certificate verification.
# Without a CA certificate, the connection may fail if the server uses
# a self-signed certificate.
#
# To extract the CA certificate from a Windows server:
#   1. On the VPN server, open Certificate Manager (certmgr.msc)
#   2. Navigate to: Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Certificates
#   3. Find your CA certificate, right-click > All Tasks > Export
#   4. Export as "Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)"
#   5. Rename to ca.crt and place in the vpn/ directory
